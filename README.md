## Project structure

- **config.py**: 
    - Configuration file. It contains some design parameters of the application, such as background color of the buttons, font-size of the text, and others that define the style and appearance of the graphical interface. 
  
- **funs.py**: 
    - Contains all the functions related to business logic and interactions with the graphical interface. These functions handle tasks such as loading files, processing data, generating plots, and controlling the widgets in the interface (like buttons, text boxes, etc.).
  
- **main.py**: 
    - This file is the entry point of the application. It initializes the main window, sets up the graphical interface, and connects the functions defined in `funs.py` to the interface events and actions.
